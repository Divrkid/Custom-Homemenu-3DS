# What changed? What is modified?
## KOR region support:
* Theme support (with the help of [@ZeroSkill](https://github.com/ZeroSkill1))

* Badges section translated (you need to have badges and a NNID to see it),


## For all regions:
* Custom animations: Folders, Power on, Launch a software, Dialog (windows like "closing software"), Sleep mode screen and more!,
* Faster camera load when pressing L+R (removed 10 frames),
* Removed Y and LR buttons showing on top screen (pressing them show up to see what they does),
* New launcher! Inspired with old homemenu applets style (cursor will go 1 row more because I can't change it, it's the default position, sorry!),
* Changed cursors and buttons (inspired of old homemenu),
* Changed sleep screen, big button in the middle,
* Changed battery skin,
* Custom icons,
* Added transparency for windows,
* Changed HUD (the date/hour/play coins etc...),
* Changed banner/icons for applets (miiverse is now red and flash green for notifications),
* Theme menu and Homemenu layout menu is a bit darker.
